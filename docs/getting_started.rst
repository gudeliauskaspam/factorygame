Getting started
===============

In this page you will learn how to download and set up your first Factorygame
project.


Firstly you will need to download and install `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_.

After you have downloaded and installed Python, you must open a command window and
enter these commands:

::
    python -m pip install factorygame-dave22153

This command will download and install the Factorygame engine that you will need to
create your projects. This will pull a stable release version and is most likely the
version you want to use. However, you are clone the git repository if you please.


Now you have everything downloaded and installed, you can run the demos to see what's
possible with this game engine. The demos can be found in the installation directory
by running the ``run_test.py`` file. This will open a GUI window showing all the
available demos.
